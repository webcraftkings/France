  <h1>Professional Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    Engaging in a professional activity in France is subject to different formalities depending on your situation—whether you're self-employed, an employee, your business type, and your length of stay.
  </p>

  <h2>As a Self-Employed Person</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Come to France for business</a> to meet your commercial and professional obligations.</li>
    <li>Want to start or take part in a <a href="#">self-employed or liberal activity</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>As an Employee</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Be posted by your employer</a> to provide a service.</li>
    <li><a href="#">Participate in intra-group mobility</a> while remaining contractually attached to your employer as an ICT (Intra Corporate Transferee) or with a local contract in France.</li>
    <li>You've been <a href="#">hired for a fixed or indefinite period</a> by a French employer. This may include seasonal contracts.</li>
    <li><a href="#">Take part in a professional course</a> in a training organisation or company.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="important">Important:</p>
  <p>
    Certain professions (e.g. doctors, teachers) have specific conditions to meet before they can practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're contributing to France’s economic appeal as an employee or self-employed individual—an <a href="#">international talent</a>—you can also make arrangements accordingly.
